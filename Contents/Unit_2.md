## 2.5 Carbon Footprint

The **carbon footprint** is a measure of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, product, or activity, expressed in **tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ equivalent (tCO‚ÇÇe)**. It quantifies the contribution to global warming and is a critical metric in sustainable development and climate policy.

### üîë Components

1. **Direct Emissions**

   * From fuel combustion, vehicles, industrial processes.

2. **Indirect Emissions**

   * From electricity use, heat, or steam consumed.

3. **Embedded (Lifecycle) Emissions**

   * Emissions from manufacturing, transportation, construction, or disposal of materials and products.

### üìå Examples in Civil Engineering

| Activity                   | Emission Source     | tCO‚ÇÇe/unit |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| 1 m¬≥ conventional concrete | Cement production   | 0.9‚Äì1.1    |
| 1 km asphalt road          | Bitumen + machinery | 0.5‚Äì0.7    |
| 1 kWh electricity (India)  | Coal-dominated grid | 0.82       |
| 1 m¬≤ steel structure       | Steel production    | 1.8‚Äì2.0    |

*Observation:* Cement and steel dominate the embodied carbon of infrastructure projects, making low-carbon alternatives crucial.

### üå± Reduction Strategies

## 2.6 Carbon Sequestration ‚Äì Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

**Carbon sequestration** refers to **the capture and long-term storage of CO‚ÇÇ** to prevent its release into the atmosphere. CCS is one of the most promising technologies for mitigating climate change in industrial and power-generation sectors.

### üîë Mechanisms of Sequestration

1. **Biological Sequestration** üå≥

   * Forests, wetlands, grasslands absorb CO‚ÇÇ naturally.
   * Example: Reforestation projects in India sequester millions of tonnes annually.

2. **Geological Sequestration** ‚õèÔ∏è

   * CO‚ÇÇ injected into **depleted oil/gas reservoirs, deep saline aquifers, or unmineable coal seams**.
   * Example: Sleipner CCS project, Norway (\~1 million tCO‚ÇÇ/year).

3. **Chemical / Industrial Sequestration** ‚öóÔ∏è

   * CO‚ÇÇ captured in industrial processes (cement, steel) or mineralized into carbonates.
   * Example: CarbFix, Iceland ‚Äì CO‚ÇÇ mineralized in basalt rock.

### üìä Global CCS Projects Overview

| Project / Location   | Type           | CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered (tCO‚ÇÇ/year) | Notes                     |
