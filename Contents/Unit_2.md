## 2.4 Carbon Credits and Carbon Trading

### 2.4.1 Carbon Credits

A carbon credit is a tradable certificate that represents the right to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or an equivalent amount of other greenhouse gases (GHGs).

- These credits are generated when an activity or project reduces, avoids, or removes GHG emissions (e.g., renewable energy projects, reforestation, energy efficiency measures).
- They provide an economic incentive for organizations to adopt cleaner technologies and sustainable practices.

* Right to emit **1 tonne of CO₂**  
* Incentivizes emission reduction  
* Generated via renewable energy, reforestation, energy efficiency  
* Surplus credits can be sold; excess emitters must buy

### 2.4.2 Carbon Trading

Carbon trading is a market-based mechanism that allows entities (countries, companies, or organizations) to buy and sell carbon credits in order to meet emission reduction targets.

- It operates under either compliance markets (regulated by international agreements or national policies, e.g., EU-ETS) or voluntary markets (corporates or individuals offsetting emissions).
- The system promotes cost-effective emission reductions and global cooperation in combating climate change.

* Market mechanism for buying & selling credits  
* **Compliance Markets:** e.g., EU-ETS (European Union Emissions Trading System) 
* **Voluntary Markets:** e.g., airline offsets - Airline offsets compensate for CO2 emissions by investing in projects that reduce or remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere, such as renewable energy or reforestation. 
* Benefits: cost-effective emission reductions, incentives for clean tech

### 2.4.3 Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms

Kyoto, Japan, the city where the landmark international agreement was adopted on December 11, 1997, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Protocol established binding greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for industrialized nations and introduced three market-based mechanisms—the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Joint Implementation (JI), and Emissions Trading (ET)—to help achieve these goals cost-effectively. 

The Kyoto Protocol established three "flexible mechanisms" to help industrialized countries meet their emission reduction targets more cost-effectively. These mechanisms allow for flexibility in how countries achieve their emission reduction commitments, promoting cost-effectiveness and potentially stimulating sustainable development. 

* **CDM:** developed → developing countries  
* **JI:** developed → developed  
* **IET:** international emissions trading

### 2.4.4 Challenges

While sustainable engineering practices and mechanisms such as carbon trading or green certification schemes have great potential, their implementation faces several challenges:

1. **Market Volatility**  
   - The value of carbon credits and renewable energy certificates often fluctuates due to changes in international agreements, government policies, and demand–supply imbalances.  
   - This uncertainty discourages long-term investment by industries and makes project planning risky.  
   - Example: The global carbon market has witnessed significant price crashes in the past, leading to reduced confidence among stakeholders.

2. **Greenwashing Risk**  
   - Many companies use sustainability-related terms for marketing without making real changes in their operations.  
   - This creates a gap between claimed and actual environmental benefits, undermining the credibility of sustainability initiatives.  
   - Example: A firm may advertise itself as “carbon neutral” simply by purchasing cheap offsets, while continuing high emissions.

3. **Unequal Benefits**  
   - The economic and social benefits of sustainability measures are not distributed evenly across regions and communities.  
   - Developing nations or marginalized groups may find it harder to access clean technologies, finance, or benefits from carbon markets.  
   - This can widen the gap between developed and developing economies in achieving sustainability goals.

4. **Complex MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification)**  
   - Sustainable initiatives, especially carbon markets and emission reductions, require robust MRV systems to ensure transparency and accountability.  
   - However, setting up accurate MRV frameworks is technically challenging and expensive, particularly for small-scale projects.  
   - Lack of standardized procedures across countries often leads to disputes about the actual impact of reported measures.

## 2.5 Carbon Footprint

The **carbon footprint** is a measure of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, product, or activity, expressed in **tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e)**. It quantifies the contribution to global warming and is a critical metric in sustainable development and climate policy.

### 🔑 Components

1. **Direct Emissions**

   * From fuel combustion, vehicles, industrial processes.

2. **Indirect Emissions**

   * From electricity use, heat, or steam consumed.

3. **Embedded (Lifecycle) Emissions**

   * Emissions from manufacturing, transportation, construction, or disposal of materials and products.

### 📌 Examples in Civil Engineering

| Activity                   | Emission Source     | tCO₂e/unit |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| 1 m³ conventional concrete | Cement production   | 0.9–1.1    |
| 1 km asphalt road          | Bitumen + machinery | 0.5–0.7    |
| 1 kWh electricity (India)  | Coal-dominated grid | 0.82       |
| 1 m² steel structure       | Steel production    | 1.8–2.0    |

*Observation:* Cement and steel dominate the embodied carbon of infrastructure projects, making low-carbon alternatives crucial.

### 🌱 Reduction Strategies

* **Low-Carbon Materials:** Fly ash, GGBS, recycled aggregates, bamboo, timber.
* **Optimized Construction Techniques:** Reduce machinery use, modular construction.
* **Renewable Energy Integration:** Solar-powered sites, electric vehicles.
* **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA):** Identify emissions hotspots to optimize processes.
* **Policy & Standards:** Encourage carbon labelling and emission caps.

## 2.6 Carbon Sequestration – Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

**Carbon sequestration** refers to **the capture and long-term storage of CO₂** to prevent its release into the atmosphere. CCS is one of the most promising technologies for mitigating climate change in industrial and power-generation sectors.

### 🔑 Mechanisms of Sequestration

1. **Biological Sequestration** 🌳

   * Forests, wetlands, grasslands absorb CO₂ naturally.
   * Example: Reforestation projects in India sequester millions of tonnes annually.

2. **Geological Sequestration** ⛏️

   * CO₂ injected into **depleted oil/gas reservoirs, deep saline aquifers, or unmineable coal seams**.
   * Example: Sleipner CCS project, Norway (\~1 million tCO₂/year).

3. **Chemical / Industrial Sequestration** ⚗️

   * CO₂ captured in industrial processes (cement, steel) or mineralized into carbonates.
   * Example: CarbFix, Iceland – CO₂ mineralized in basalt rock.

### 📊 Global CCS Projects Overview

| Project / Location   | Type           | CO₂ Sequestered (tCO₂/year) | Notes                     |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sleipner, Norway     | Geological     | 1,000,000                   | Saline aquifer storage    |
| Boundary Dam, Canada | CCS Power      | 1,000,000                   | Coal-fired power plant    |
| China Green Ocean    | Biological     | 100,000                     | Mangrove restoration      |
| CarbFix, Iceland     | Mineralization | 70,000                      | CO₂ mineralized in basalt |

### 🌱 Benefits and Limitations
