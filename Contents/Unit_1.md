## 1.1 Need and Concept of Sustainability  

### 📖 Concept  
Sustainability refers to the ability to **meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs** (Brundtland Commission Report, 1987).  

It involves maintaining a balance among three interconnected pillars:  
- **Environmental Sustainability** – protecting natural resources and ecosystems.  
- **Social Sustainability** – ensuring human well-being, equity, and community development.  
- **Economic Sustainability** – promoting long-term economic growth without creating negative externalities.

### 🌍 Why Sustainability is Needed in Civil Engineering?  
1. **Rapid Urbanization** → Rising demand for infrastructure, but with resource constraints.  
2. **Climate Change** → Civil engineering contributes heavily to CO₂ emissions (cement, steel).  
3. **Resource Depletion** → Non-renewable resources like sand, aggregates, fossil fuels are shrinking.  
4. **Waste Generation** → Construction & demolition waste contributes to environmental pollution.  
5. **Future Security** → Engineers must design systems that last longer and consume fewer resources.  

### 📌 Key Takeaways  
> ✅ Sustainability = Balance of environment, economy, and society.  
> ✅ Civil engineering has a major role in sustainable growth.  
> ✅ Focus is on reducing resource use, emissions, and creating resilient infrastructure.

## 1.2 Social, Environmental and Economic Sustainability Concepts  

### 📖 Concept  
Sustainability is built on the integration of **three interdependent dimensions**:  
1. **Social Sustainability**  
2. **Environmental Sustainability**  
3. **Economic Sustainability**  

Together, they form the "Triple Bottom Line" of sustainable development.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Sustainability  
- Focuses on **equity, inclusiveness, and quality of life**.  
- Involves fair distribution of resources, access to education, healthcare, and safe housing.  
- Protects cultural heritage and promotes social cohesion.  
- **Civil Engineering Context:** Designing infrastructure that is safe, affordable, accessible (e.g., barrier-free design for differently-abled persons).  

### 🌱 Environmental Sustainability  
- Aims to **conserve natural resources** and reduce ecological damage.  
- Minimizes pollution, promotes biodiversity, and ensures renewable energy use.  
- Encourages eco-friendly practices such as green buildings, rainwater harvesting, and waste recycling.  
- **Civil Engineering Context:** Using fly ash in concrete, designing energy-efficient buildings, reducing construction waste.  

### 💰 Economic Sustainability  
- Ensures that growth and development are **financially viable in the long run**.  
- Focuses on cost efficiency, job creation, and innovation without resource exploitation.  
- Encourages use of durable, cost-effective, and recyclable materials.  
- **Civil Engineering Context:** Life-cycle cost analysis, low-maintenance infrastructure, sustainable procurement.  

### 🔗 Interconnection (Triple Bottom Line)  
- Sustainability can only be achieved when **all three aspects work together**.  
- Example: A green building project →  
  - Uses renewable energy (**environmental**),  
  - Provides affordable housing (**social**),  
  - Ensures low life-cycle costs (**economic**).  

### 📌 Key Takeaways  
> ✅ Sustainability stands on **three pillars: Social, Environmental, and Economic**.  
> ✅ Civil engineers must balance all three in planning, design, and execution.  
> ✅ Ignoring one pillar leads to imbalance and unsustainable growth.
